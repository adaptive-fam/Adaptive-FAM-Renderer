## Adaptive-FAM: *GPU-Accelerated Out-of-Core Volume Rendering with Functional Approximation and Adaptive Encoding for Interactive Exploration*

![results](https://github.com/adaptive-fam/Adaptive-FAM/blob/main/flame_blocks_small.png)

### Introduction
This repo contains the code of the renderer that generates visualization results through decoding micro-models encoded by Adaptive-FAM. The rendering framework supports:

-Multi-resolution for faster loading of content of interest.

-Out-of-core caching for handling large-scale input data.

-GPU-acceleration through CUDA kernel functions.
